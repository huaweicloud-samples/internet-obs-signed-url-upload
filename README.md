This practice implements a serverless pattern in which the backend issues authorization only and the client transfers the file. A web page requests a PUT authorization URL for a single object, then sends the image bytes directly to object storage. The function never handles the file body and never holds long-lived keys. It is intended for backend, frontend, and DevOps engineers as a reference architecture and learning sample.
